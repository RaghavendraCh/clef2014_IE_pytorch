we pro- vide a methodology to extract information for understanding the status of the disease/disorder. The status of disease/disorder is based on dif- ferent attributes like temporal information, severity and progression of the disease.

They are Negation Indicator, Subject Class, Uncertainty Indicator, Course Class, Severity Class, Conditional Class, Generic Class, Body Location, DocTime Class, and Temporal Expression.
